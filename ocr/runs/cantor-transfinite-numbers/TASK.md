# Task

Take one text that is ALREADY TRANSCRIBED further through the Enchiridion pipeline.

**The text:** Georg Cantor, *Contributions to the Founding of the Theory of Transfinite Numbers* (`cantor-transfinite-numbers`). Its sources are in `source/`,
along with the metadata the library currently holds for it.

**This is a repair job, not an extraction.** `source/` contains the markdown
the library currently publishes for this text, alongside the original it was
made from. That markdown is the subject of the work: improve it in place rather
than re-deriving it. The original is there so you can check the markdown against
it — it is the page witness, and where the two disagree the page is right.

Which stage the work belongs to is yours to determine from the state of the
file. Say what you concluded and why.

**The repository** is at `/Users/zacharygrunenberg/Projects/Enchiridion`, readable but not writable by you. Start with
`/Users/zacharygrunenberg/Projects/Enchiridion/ocr/README.md`. Use `/Users/zacharygrunenberg/Projects/Enchiridion/ocr/.venv/bin/python3` where PyMuPDF is
needed — it imports as `pymupdf`, not `fitz`.

**Where you may write:** this workspace, and nowhere else.

## How the pipeline is arranged

A text moves through numbered stages: `0-recon`, `1-prepare`, `2-extract`,
`3-postprocess`, `4-proofread`. Unnumbered directories are called from anywhere —
`verify/` holds checks that never edit, `figures/` and `drama/` are tracks that
span several stages, `text-specific-tools/` holds per-text work and its
precedents are worth reading before you write your own.

Each stage carries a `STAGE.md` saying what it consumes, what it produces, what
test says it succeeded, and what that test does not check. The last field is the
useful one. There is no brief specific to your text; if these documents leave you
guessing, that is a fact about them worth reporting.

## What the checks are for

Most checks here answer a narrower question than their name suggests, and knowing
which question is worth more than running them.

The diagnostic triad asks whether a renderer can handle the notation. It is
informative exactly to the degree the text contains notation, and it says nothing
about whether the words are the right words. A text with no mathematics will pass
it while telling you nothing.

Two sources agreeing is weaker evidence than it looks. An epub and a PDF built
from one transcription, or a PDF generated from the TeX beside it, are two
renderings of a single act of copying: they establish fidelity, never
correctness. Where that is the situation, say so rather than letting agreement
stand in for a second witness.

And a probe that finds nothing has proved nothing until it has been shown to find
a case known to exist. Four separate false conclusions here came from believing a
zero. Ship a negative control, or a positive one — compare a page with itself
before trusting a duplicate scan that reports none.

## Working on the text

Never edit the text by hand. Repairs go through a script with asserted anchors
and counts, so that a wrong edit is reviewable rather than invisible, and so the
work can be re-derived when a source is re-extracted. Run the relevant acceptance
test after each change and report what it said.

## When to stop and ask

Stopping is a good outcome, and three kinds of question are worth stopping for.

**A decision that is ours to make.** Apparatus is the standing example: editorial
introductions, notes-on-the-text and bibliographies come out, while authorial
footnotes and a translator's bracketed interpolations stay — and getting it
backwards deletes the author. Alternating verse and prose is another; a
whole-work verse declaration shatters prose that alternates with it. These fail
invisibly, which is why they are worth a question rather than a guess.

**Permission, which is not a judgment at all.** Network access, or anything that
spends money or touches an external service — running the OCR API, for instance,
where a mistake upstream means paying to do it again. Ask; do not decide.

**The method's premise does not hold here.** If the approach the documents assume
turns out not to apply to your text — no independent witness where one was
presumed, a stage contract written for PDFs when a better source is not a PDF —
that is the most valuable thing you can tell us, because it corrects the
documents rather than the text.

To stop: write `ESCALATION.md` in this workspace saying what you need and what
turns on it, then finish. Your session is resumable, so you will be restarted
with an answer and your context intact. A blocked stage with a clear account
beats a finished text with a silent guess, because nothing downstream can catch
a guess.

## Two things about the reader you cannot infer from the source

In-page links do not work here. The router keys on the URL hash, so a footnote
link does not fail quietly — it sends the reader to the front page and loses
their place; and sections are built lazily, so the target is usually not present
anyway. Keep a superscript marker, which is the author's and tells a reader which
sentence carries the note, and drop the navigation around it.
`3-postprocess/strip-inpage-anchors.py` does exactly this.

The first `h1` in a file is treated as the document title, and lazy sectioning
begins at the second. So a collected volume needs its own title as the opening
`h1` — otherwise the whole of the first work stays eager and never collapses.

## Naming your result

If you produce a text you believe belongs in the library, write `PROPOSED.md`
naming the file in backticks and saying what you verified about it. Adoption is
not yours to perform — the corpus is outside your sandbox by design — but a run
that leaves several markdown files and no proposal cannot be adopted without
someone guessing which one you meant. One earlier run left a raw extraction and a
draft side by side, and neither was labelled.

A proposal is not a claim that the text is finished. Adoption sets its status to
`needs-review`: machine-checked, and not yet read against the source by a person.

## What to write down

Keep `NOTES.md`. The processing is the smaller half of this; what the attempt
teaches about the pipeline is the larger half. Worth recording: what you decided
and on what evidence, where the documentation was wrong or missing or
contradicted what you found, what you could not settle, and anything true beyond
this one text.

Note also where the time went — which steps were slow, and whether each was slow
because the work is genuinely intricate or because the tooling made it harder
than it needed to be. We cannot tell those apart from the outside.

Do not mark anything complete that you have not verified, and do not change
`ocr_status` to claim a completeness you could not establish.
